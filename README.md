## Introduction
This is my portfolio which includes an about me section, links to my most recent pieces; Upbeat Atlas, Sustain, and Commute Calculator, and a contact section.


## Use Case
Why is this app useful? This app provides information about me so I can share my skills with future employers to get a rocking job as a developer.

## UX

Initial wireframes for my portfolio can be seen below. Wireframes of all key processes were designed along with data flow and user questions for key tasks.
